# tensorflow-node-examples
[Tensorflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) Node.js Examples. Inspired from official [tfjs-examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples).

## Disclaimer
Tensorflow.js for Node.js (namely `tfjs-node`) is currently in development status, see [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node).

## Why?
Because officiale Tensorflow.js examples are mostly written in TypeScript or use the async/awaiy paradigma, while the most of node modules are not.

## Node.js Examples

## Getting Started
Tf.js Hello World for Node.js: training and predict.

## Sentiment
Load and predict sentiment from a pre-trained sentiment model with `tf.loadModel`.

## LSTM
A simple LSTM train example that shows accuracy, loss, while training.

## Translation
A bilinear LSTM (bi-LSTM) for `EN-FR` translation with a local hosted saved model. Full examples: load model, translate sentences.

## LSTM Text Generation
A bi-LSTM model that learns to write as Nietzsche or your favorite text. Work in progress, so far it loads the saved model only.
